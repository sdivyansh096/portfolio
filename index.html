<p class="about2">
    My name is Divyansh Sharma, and I'm a Btech student at Chitkara University's Computer Science Department. I have always been fascinated by the world of technology and computers, and that curiosity led me to pursue my studies in computer science.

    Throughout my journey as a student, I've developed a passion for website design and development. The idea of creating something visual and interactive on the internet excites me. I enjoy exploring the vast world of web technologies, from crafting elegant user interfaces to implementing complex backend functionalities.

    Along with web development, I've also found myself drawn to the world of algorithms and data structures. The challenge of solving intricate problems and optimizing code keeps me motivated to continuously improve my skills.

    My dream is to become a Software Development Engineer (SDE) at a leading tech company, and I'm working with unwavering dedication to achieve that goal. I'm constantly challenging myself with new projects, seeking feedback, and striving for excellence.

    Beyond the world of programming, I'm a travel enthusiast. Exploring new places, meeting people from diverse backgrounds, and experiencing various cultures have enriched my life in ways I never imagined. Traveling has taught me to adapt, be open-minded, and appreciate the beauty of our diverse world.

    When I'm not coding or traveling, you can often find me engaging in outdoor activities, playing sports with friends, or trying out new culinary delights.

    Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I'm excited about the possibilities that lie ahead, and I'm eager to embark on new adventures in the realm of technology.
